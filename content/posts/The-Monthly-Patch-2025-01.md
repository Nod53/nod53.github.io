# **The Monthly Patch 2025.01**  

Welcome to **The Monthly Patch**, a new blog series where I document my cybersecurity journey, both personal and professional. My goal with this blog is twofold:  
1. To serve as a **motivational tool**—tracking my progress and pushing myself to continuously improve.  
2. To provide a **transparent record** of my learning journey—allowing potential employers and like-minded professionals to see my dedication to cybersecurity growth.  

Each month, I'll cover my progress, learning experiences, projects, and future goals. Now, let's dive into **January 2025**!

## **📜 Wrapping Up 2024: My Cybersecurity Milestone**  

December 2024 was a **major milestone** for me—I officially **graduated with a Diploma of Cybersecurity with Distinction**, achieving a **GPA of 6.5**. This was a huge accomplishment after a full year of intense study.  

To celebrate, I took the rest of December off to **spend time with family, unwind, and recharge** after a demanding academic year.

## **🚀 January: The Job Hunt Begins**  

With the new year in full swing, I shifted my focus to landing a cybersecurity role. This month, I:  

- **Refined my resume** and **updated my LinkedIn** and other job-seeking profiles.  
- **Applied for around 40 jobs** in cybersecurity-related fields. While this isn’t a massive number, I wanted to **prioritise quality over quantity**—tailoring applications for roles that align with my interests and skillset.  
- My goal for **February** is to **increase applications** while securing interviews and, ideally, receiving offers.

## **💻 Getting Back to Hands-On Learning**  

Now that my formal studies are complete, I’m **returning to TryHackMe** to continue upskilling. Specifically, I aim to:  

✅ **Complete the SOC Level 1 Learning Path** before the end of February.  

I’ve also started the **Google Cybersecurity Certificate on Coursera**. Although it’s structured as a 3–6 month program (at 7 hours per week), I believe my existing knowledge will allow me to **fast-track my progress and complete it in February**.

## **📝 Expanding My Knowledge Base**  

I’ve been maintaining cybersecurity notes in **Obsidian**, and I plan to:  

- Continue **expanding my notes** with key concepts, attack techniques, and defensive strategies.  
- Explore **alternative platforms** in case I find a more efficient solution for managing and organizing my cybersecurity knowledge.

## **🌍 Staying Up to Date with Industry Trends**  

Keeping up with industry developments is crucial, so I’ve been:  

- **Watching Simply Cyber's Daily Cyber Threat Brief** with Gerald Auger to stay informed on real-world cybersecurity threats.  
- Exploring **SIEM lab projects**, inspired by one of Gerald Auger’s videos on **building a home SIEM setup** to practice detecting, analyzing, and responding to security events.  

My plan for **February** is to **set up a SIEM lab** in my home lab environment, so I can better understand **log analysis, alerts, and security monitoring**.
