# **The Monthly Patch 2025.02**  

February has been a **busy and productive month**, filled with job applications, technical learning, and hands-on projects. While progress hasn’t always been as fast as I’d like, I’ve gained valuable insights from both my job search and my cybersecurity studies.

## **🚀 Job Hunt & Career Progress**  

This month, I completed refining my **resume** and **updated my LinkedIn profile**, and the results have been noticeable—I've seen a **significant increase in positive responses** to my job applications.  

I’m continuing to apply for both **Help Desk and Cybersecurity roles**, though breaking into the **SOC Analyst job market** without prior SOC experience has proven to be a challenge. However, I’ve had **several interviews**, and while I’m still waiting to hear back on some, the feedback I’ve received has been **incredibly valuable**.  

Most rejections have been due to **other candidates having more experience**, but the recruiters I’ve spoken with have been **open and honest**, providing **constructive feedback** on where I can improve. I’ve **appreciated their time and insights**, and I’m using this feedback to **refine my approach and skillset** moving forward.

## **📚 Technical Learning & Hands-On Experience**  

I’ve been **actively learning on TryHackMe** this month and made great progress—moving from the **top 10% of users to the top 4%** on the platform.  

Originally, I had planned to complete the **SOC Level 1 learning path, the Google Cybersecurity Certificate, and job hunting** all within February. However, that turned out to be **too ambitious** given the amount of time needed to **prepare for interviews and refine my job applications**.  

### **Achievements:**  
✅ **Completed 50% of the SOC Level 1 learning path** on TryHackMe.  
✅ **Decided to focus on SOC training over the Google Cybersecurity Certificate** (which I’ll return to later).  
✅ **Continued adding and refining my notes in Obsidian** while working through my studies.  
✅ **Uploaded my public notes to GitHub for easier reference and sharing.**  

Next month, I plan to **finish the SOC Level 1 learning path** and explore **ways to apply what I’ve learned in practical lab environments**.

## **🛠️ Home Lab & Technical Projects**  

This month, I **expanded my home lab setup** with some exciting new additions:  

🔥 **Set up a Kali Linux VM on my unRAID server** – This allows me to securely **access my pentesting environment from anywhere** via VPN, making it easier to work on TryHackMe from any device while traveling.  

🔥 **Found a method to self-host my Obsidian notes on unRAID** – A Reddit post inspired me to explore this, and I plan to **set up a self-hosted Obsidian vault in March**. This will give me **greater control over my knowledge base** while keeping it accessible from anywhere.  

🔥 **Worked with Snort IDS for TryHackMe labs** – While I haven’t started my **full SIEM lab yet**, I enjoyed working with **Snort for intrusion detection**, and I’m considering setting up **a dedicated IDS on one of my Raspberry Pi devices**.

## **🔍 Skill Gaps & Learning Focus for March**  

Through **technical interview assessments**, I identified areas that need improvement:  

- **SQL & Python for cybersecurity applications** – Some assessments required **SQL knowledge** for database queries, and I realised I need to **refresh my SQL skills** so I was better prepared to complete these tasks without my notes and reference material.  
- **Intermediate Python scripting** – I want to **improve my ability to automate security tasks**, such as **cleaning up logs to make them more readable**.  

To address these gaps, I’ll be **diving deeper into SQL and Python**, and I plan to **document my learning process and automation scripts on GitHub**.

## **📰 Staying Updated on Cybersecurity News**  

I continued following **Simply Cyber’s Daily Threat Brief**, **TL;DR’s Cybersecurity Newsletter**, and **The Hacker News** to stay informed on industry trends.  

### **Key Cybersecurity News Highlight – CVE-2025-0108**  

One of the biggest vulnerabilities this month was **CVE-2025-0108**, a **critical flaw in Palo Alto Networks' PAN-OS**.  

- It **allowed unauthenticated attackers to bypass authentication** on the **management web interface** and execute PHP scripts.  
- The **EPSS score was around 97%**, meaning it had an extremely high probability of being exploited in the wild.  
- **Confirmed active exploitation** was occurring at the time of disclosure.  

This vulnerability was a stark reminder of the importance of **proper access controls and patch management**.

## **🎯 March 2025 Goals**  

✅ **Continue applying for cybersecurity and IT roles, focusing on Help Desk and SOC Analyst positions.**  
✅ **Complete the TryHackMe SOC Level 1 Learning Path.**  
✅ **Deep dive into SQL and Python for cybersecurity applications.**  
✅ **Start my SIEM lab setup.**  
✅ **Self-host my Obsidian notes on unRAID.**  
✅ **Experiment with setting up an IDS on a Raspberry Pi.**
